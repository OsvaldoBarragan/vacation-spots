<h1>Vacation Spots</h1>
<p>Vacation Spots is a website where you can view locations by other users such as yourself and even create some of your own. In addition, users are given the ability to review these locations and give them ratings.<p>


<b>Planning:</b> My plan for this project was always starting on the API and continuing on it until every model and route worked perfectly. From there, I would work on the front-end, action by action, until I got the results I wanted. If I got stuck, I would research the problem online. If that didn't work, I would ask for help.
Technologies Used: MongoDB, Express

<b>Unsolved Problems:</b>

<p>As stated in the user stories, I still want to add the ability for users to favorite locations that they enjoy. Another problem that I still have is that the CSS is not the most attractive to most users. I will be fixing these problems soon.</p>
